# Watershed Data Analysis Project 2

## Introduction

This project focuses on the analysis of the Watershed dataset, developed from various variables, explanations, descriptions, and specific data within the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Index of Watershed Indicators. The primary objective is to examine the quality of watersheds across different regions and their associated pollutant levels, providing insights that can inform environmental management and policy decisions.

## Data Source

The data for this project is sourced from the Watershed dataset, which is available through the EPA’s Index of Watershed Indicators. This dataset includes comprehensive information on watershed quality and conventional pollutant levels.

## Data Description

The Watershed dataset includes several key variables:

- **Region**: The geographical area of the watershed.
- **Quality**: The quality of watersheds, categorized as:
  1. Better quality, low vulnerability
  2. Better quality, high vulnerability
  3. Moderate quality, low vulnerability
  4. Moderate quality, high vulnerability
  5. Serious quality, low vulnerability
  6. Serious quality, high vulnerability
- **Conpolut**: The level of conventional pollutants in the watershed.

## Summary of Analysis

The analysis involved creating a pivot table to examine the mean level of conventional pollutants (Conpolut) across different regions and quality categories. This approach helps to identify patterns and trends in pollutant levels relative to watershed quality and vulnerability.

## Key Questions Answered

1. **What is the mean level of conventional pollutants (Conpolut) across different watershed quality categories?**
2. **How does the vulnerability of a watershed (low vs. high) affect the level of pollutants?**
3. **What trends can be observed in the pollutant levels as the quality of watersheds decreases?**

## Findings

- **Mean Pollutant Levels**: The average values of conventional pollutants generally increase from left to right within each row of the pivot table, indicating higher pollutant levels with increasing vulnerability.
- **Quality and Vulnerability Trends**: Higher quality watersheds (categories 1 and 2) tend to have lower pollutant averages compared to moderate or serious quality watersheds (categories 3, 4, 5, and 6).
- **Overall Trends**: The Grand Total row shows an overall average Conpolut value of 18.34, highlighting the general level of pollutants across all quality and vulnerability categories.

The analysis indicates a clear relationship between watershed quality, vulnerability, and pollutant levels, with more vulnerable and lower-quality watersheds experiencing higher levels of conventional pollutants.

This structured approach ensures that the Watershed Data Analysis Project is presented clearly and professionally, making it a valuable addition to your portfolio.
